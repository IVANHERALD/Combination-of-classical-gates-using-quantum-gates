# Combination-of-classical-gates-using-quantum-gates

This project is done using python to convert Classical Circuits into Quantum Circuits and creating a combination of classical circuits using quantum gates.
Multiplexer and D-flip flop are combined and qunatum solution is made.
The output of Multiplexer is given as input for D flip flop.
